## How do I write a good README?
Without practice there is no success. Access [the template](https://github.com/Bodera/goodPractices_Github/blob/master/contributing-the-right-way/essence-of-good-readmes.md) in the repository of good practices when working in GitHub, there are available some orientations and hyperlinks that act as reference about how to contribute assertively.
